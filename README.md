# DumbDnDCompiled

1. Run the DumbDnD.exe within the game folder to play the game be very careful what you input as you can crash the game, there isn't much error handling due to time constraints. If it asks for an int, type an int (with no space), if it asks for "yes" type yes (or hit enter for the default) and if it asks for a name wright a name.
2. While the game is running it will constantly update the log.json file in the main directory (one above the Game folder)
3. After the game is complete, run the DataVisualization.exe in the main directory and wait...It will take some time up to 2 minutes. It is compiled Python and it most certainly not optimised for being compiled but it WILL work.
4. Edit the graphs how you like or just save them. They will show in order, the Player health over turns graph will show first, after you close it, The Player gold over turns graph will apear.
